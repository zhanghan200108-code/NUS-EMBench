This dataset contains wideband impedance measurements of Common-Mode Chokes (CMCs) wound on various magnetic cores. All raw data were acquired using a Rohde & Schwarz ZNLE6 Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) with a logarithmic frequency sweep from 100 kHz to 200 MHz, providing 1001 uniformly log-spaced sample points per measurement. Although 1-turn CMCs are rarely used in practical applications, their S-parameter data are also included to ensure completeness and continuity across the full turn-number range.

Each directory in the dataset is named after the magnetic core type (e.g., W452, W358), and contains a collection of Touchstone .s2p files representing the raw S-parameter measurements. The naming follows a simple and consistent rule: each .s2p file is named by the turn number of the corresponding CMC sample (for example, 32.s2p corresponds to a 32-turn CMC). Within the same directory, a corresponding .csv file summarizes the computed common-mode impedance for all samples using that core, with frequency, real-part, and imaginary-part data consolidated for convenient analysis and modeling.
